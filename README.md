# Rusty dark syntax theme for Atom

A theme designed to color-hint certain patterns in code.

The guidelines are not strict, because they are impossible to define strictly
in a mess that is Atom CSS. However the following rules are roughly followed:

- Actual code is orange
- Keywords and types favor blue
- Control structures use a very distinct green
- Type bounds favor brown
- Comments are readable
- Strings are green
- Other colors are used to hint very special cases

Works nicely with these languages at the minimum: `rust`, `js`, `html`, `css`,
`less`, `java`, `lua`, `php`, `bash`, `toml`, `markdown`, `protobuf`, `sql`.
