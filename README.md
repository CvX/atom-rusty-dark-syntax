# Rusty dark syntax theme for Atom

The main motivation was to make a syntax theme that works well for the
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language. All I needed was suitable
inspiration. How would rusty theme look like? Let's see:

Of course, I tried not overdo it and keep it functional. This resulted in
folowing choices:

- Actual code is a bit brown
- Keywords and types favor blue
- Control structures use a very distinct green
- Type bounds favor brown
- Comments are readable grey
- Strings are green
- There are colors to hint very special cases, like unsafe

Of course, I also tested it with other languages, in particular: `js`, `html`, `css`,
`less`, `java`, `lua`, `php`, `bash`, `toml`, `markdown`, `protobuf`, `sql`.

The result:
